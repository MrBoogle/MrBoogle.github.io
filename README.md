# Dev branch of my website
I do my dev work here and merge it with main when a change is ready to go live.

Things to fix:

Urgent
- Skills section should be side by side instead of downwards after 568px

Non-urgent
- Include responsivity for 1920x1080 screens
- All buttons should have animations
- Fix "Contact" section highlighting
- Add mailto to email in contact section

When done, start customizing
- Fill out own information/experience
- Get a professional headshot and about me picture
- Add scroll reveal https://scrollrevealjs.org
